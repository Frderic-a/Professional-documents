Cybersecurity-professional-statement


Two years ago I passed the IT support certificate and I would love to extend it. 
I have not yet had the opportunity and possibility to work in this field.
I want to learn more, about :
protecting systems, networks, and data from attacks, unauthorized access, or damage. 
It's about keeping digital information safe from threats for myself, other companies, or organisations I will work for in the future.
